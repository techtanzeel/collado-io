## Me, In A Bullet List
Quiet, family guy, born and raised in Barcelona.

* 🎓 Industrial engineer by trade
* 🤹‍♂️ Devoted [product manager](https://linkedin.com/in/marccollado) by day
* 👨‍💻 [Programmer aficionado](https://github.com/MarcCollado) by night
* 🏃‍♂️ [Avid runner](https://www.strava.com/athletes/marccollado) by default

## What I've Been Up To
* In 2011, upon graduating from college, co-founded [iomando technologies](/work/iomando) — a startup pioneering keyless access management for mobile devices that ended up acquired by [Citibox](https://citibox.com/).
* In 2015, decided to switch gears and pursue another [passion of mine](/tags/education) and joined [Ironhack](/work/ironhack) to change the way we learn about technology — establishing the city operations from the ground up.

## Other Than That
I devote almost all my free time to 📚 [reading](/tags/books/) books, 🏋️‍♂️ [training](/tags/sub3/), and 🏗 [building](/work/pansa/), mostly, useless things.
