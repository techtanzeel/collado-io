2019 will start by consolidating and doubling down on the same 2018' themes, but with a slightly different focus.

### Training
Keeping up with the ~~obsession~~ goal of [running a marathon under three hours](/tags/sub3), the next stop, after [missing the mark](https://www.strava.com/activities/1996244257) — just by 39 seconds — in Valencia, will be the [Sevilla Marathon](http://www.zurichmaratonsevilla.es/) on the 17th of February and my hometown' [Barcelona Marathon](https://www.zurichmaratobarcelona.es/) on the 10th of March.

Both Sevilla and Barcelona should clock somewhere between 3h10min and 3h15min, the closer to the former, the better.

### Coding
A [growing discontent](/blog/2018/broken-notes) with note-taking apps has recently gotten all my attention, to the extent that I've decided to create [my own thing](https://github.com/MarcCollado/pansa).

I'm still not sure where this is going. I could end up nowhere with "yet another" note-taking app, finding out that it simply can't be done... or maybe, just maybe, creating an amazing product that solves all my note-related pains.

What I do know is that [pansa](/work/pansa) will become one of the most delightful side projects I have ever worked on and that I'll be having the time of my life building it.

### Reading
I want to keep on reading a couple of books per month, but also reinstate the practice of publishing my [book notes](/tags/books) — even if they aren't extremely polished.

Early 2019, these will be my eight book pickings:

* [Stumbling on Happiness](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GCFW0A/)
* [Predictably Irrational](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002RI9QJE/)
* [Fooled by Randomness](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002RI9BH6/)
* [The Wisdom of Crowds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FCKC3I/)
* [The Power of Habit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006WAIV6M/)
* [Hooked](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NW01MKM/)
* [Creative Selection](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079DVT6VP/)
* [Flash Boys](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HVJB4VM/)
