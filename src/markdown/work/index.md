Despite _work_ doesn't fully capture the essence of this page — since it aims to showcase both companies I've been professionally involved with, but also random side-projects of mine — I must admit, I couldn't find a better signifier.

Before you jump in though, here's a little bit of context on some of the projects:

- iomando: in 2011, upon graduating from college, I co-founded iomando technologies — a startup pioneering keyless access management for mobile devices. We built a really cool product and ended up acquired by [Citibox](https://www.citibox.com/) in late 2017, which integrated iomando's technology into their core product — the smart mailboxes
- Ironhack: in 2015, after a short-lived, [failed attempt](/blog/2015/hi-from-ironhack) to take a sabbatical, I decided to switch gears and pursue [another passion of mine](/tags/education) and joined [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/) to change the way we learn about technology. First as the Campus Manager in Barcelona, establishing the city operations from the ground up, and later on as a Product Manager.

Oh, and by the way, [reach out](https://twitter.com/MarcCollado) if come up with a better (ideally less than five-letter) name that more accurately describes this page 😅
